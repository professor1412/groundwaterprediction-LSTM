LSTM Groundwater Forecasting App

This is a Streamlit web application for forecasting groundwater levels using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The application takes rainfall data as input and predicts groundwater levels for specific geographic locations (latitude and longitude). Additionally, it provides multi-step future forecasts beyond the training data.
Features

    Interactive UI: Enter latitude, longitude, window size, number of future steps, and epochs through the sidebar.
    LSTM Model Training: The app trains an LSTM model on the selected locationâ€™s data and predicts groundwater levels.
    Future Forecasting: Predicts future groundwater levels for a specified number of steps beyond the available data.
    Plot Results: Visualizes actual vs. predicted groundwater levels along with future forecasts.
    Error Handling: Provides informative error messages if data is insufficient for the selected location.

Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed, and then install the required packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/professor1412/groundwaterprediction-LSTM.git
cd groundwaterprediction-LSTM

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .venv\Scripts\activate

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:

    streamlit run app.py

    Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

File Descriptions

    app.py: The main Streamlit app that handles user interaction, input processing, and LSTM forecasting.
    lstm.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development.
    reshaped_groundwater_rainfall_data.csv: The dataset containing historical rainfall and groundwater level data.
    requirements.txt: A list of required Python packages.
    .venv/: Virtual environment directory (excluded using .gitignore).

How It Works

    Data Input: The app reads the dataset and filters the data by the selected latitude and longitude.
    Preprocessing: The rainfall and groundwater level data are scaled and transformed into sequences for LSTM input.
    LSTM Model: A sequential LSTM model is trained using the selected parameters (window size, epochs).
    Prediction: The model predicts groundwater levels on the test set and forecasts future steps beyond the training data.
    Visualization: The app generates a plot showing actual vs. predicted values, including future forecasts.

Example Usage

    Enter the following sample inputs in the sidebar:
        Latitude: 26.88472222
        Longitude: 78.37916667
        Future Steps: 4
        Window Size: 12
        Epochs: 20
    Click Run Forecast.
